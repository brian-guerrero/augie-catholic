**Welcome**

No man is an island. Each individual person inherently seeks to belong to another. We see this truth in a couple heading out on their first date, in a young man excited to join his college’s football or baseball team, and in the college professor walking up to the podium for the first time to teach his or her first class, as a member of an academic department. 

Human persons want to belong. Human persons want to be a part of something greater than themselves. 

Yet, we also want to matter. We want to know that we make a difference and make a positive contribution to the people, the teams, our community, and the organizations that we belong to. 

We want to belong, but we also want to matter. 

I would like us for a moment to consider all the people that we belong to and to consider as well the reality that we belong to Christ. “It is not you who have chosen Me, but I who have chosen you” (John 15:16). 

And to ponder too that in our common belonging to Christ within the Catholic Church, we matter.  We each have an individual contribution to make to fulfill the divine purpose and mandate given to the Church to announce the Gospel and to make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:19).  

Augie Catholic then isn't just one student group among many here Augustana that you belong to as a Catholic. 

It is your community of faith. It is the place where you experience anew your greatest and deepest belonging to God himself. And where you receive all that you need to carry out your part of the Church’s sacred mission. You belong here and you matter.

+Father Jeremy Freehill
