Since 2009, Campus Ministries' "Alternative Spring Break" has take Augustana students to Appalachia. Working a variety of jobs, mainly housing improvement jobs through Henderson Settlement in Frakes, Ky., the group affects the lives of others, and also their own lives.



The jobs completed throughout the week ranged from insulating an attic, to flooring projects, ramps, porches, decks, and replacing a roof on a house. Even though there is work to be done all day, there is still plenty of time to relax, reflect, and just hang out and get to know everyone better. It's safe to say that despite the 625 mile trip from Rock Island to Frakes, it is a spring break to never forget.
