This is your opportunity to serve alongside the Missionaries of Charity, the religious community of sisters founded by Mother Teresa of Calcutta. 

This scheduled overnight trip is open to all Augustana Students, and there is no financial cost to you. 

Spaces are limited to a maximum of ten students per trip, so you will want to reserve your spot.
