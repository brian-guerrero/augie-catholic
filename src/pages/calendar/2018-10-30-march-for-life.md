The March for Life is a DC March bearing witness to the beauty and inherit dignity of all unborn human life, and it brings together 100s of thousands of people throughout the US who begin marching from the DC Mall to the footsteps of the United States Supreme Count building. 

The January date is chosen to coincide with the sad anniversary of Roe Vs Wade and the legalization of direct abortion throughout our country.

You can join this trip for just $200 which covers transportation (charter bus) and hotel lodging cost.

Checks should be made payable to Iowans for Life and sent to Fr. Jeremy Freehill at Augustana College with Attn: Campus Ministries.
