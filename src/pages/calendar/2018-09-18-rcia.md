RCIA (Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults)

Each week a group of students meets with Fr. Jeremy to study the Faith of the Church and prepare to enter into communion with Christ within the Church by receiving the Sacraments.

Those of you interested in learning more about the Faith and becoming Catholic are welcome to join.
