Every Tuesday we gather for prayer in front of the Blessed Sacrament from 9:00-9:30PM with the Recitation of the Rosary.

It is followed by a brief chanted night prayer service.

> “The time you spend with Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament is the best time you will spend on earth. Each moment that you spend with Jesus will deepen your union with Him and make your soul everlastingly more glorious and beautiful in Heaven, and will help bring about everlasting peace on earth.”
>
> Mother Teresa of Calcutta
