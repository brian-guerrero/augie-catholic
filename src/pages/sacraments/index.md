#### RCIA (Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults)

RCIA is a process for non-Catholics who would like to become Catholic, Catholics who would like to be confirmed, or anyone who would merely like to learn more about the Catholic faith.

This time of preparation is focused on helping you to know, love, and serve Jesus Christ within the Catholic Church.

Wherever you are in your faith journey, we would love for you to join us in learning more about Catholicism.  For more information, please email Father Jeremy at jeremyfreehill@augustana.edu.
